# Rock_Paper_Scissors
I created a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors".

The Pseudo code - (the logic of this program in natural language)
The game involves a player and a computer.
We need to create a function called getComputerChoice for the computer that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’ 
 Write a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors. it takes in two parameters(playerSelection, computerSelection), then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
 Make the parameters case insensitive
 Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end. Use loops.
